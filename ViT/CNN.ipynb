The experiments in this assignment will take a long time to run without a GPU, but you can run the notebook remotely on Google Colab and have access to GPUs for free -- in this case you don't have to worry about installing PyTorch as it is available by default in Google Colab's environment.\n",

Try to keep your answers short and precise, and you are encouraged to write equations if needed (you can do that using markdown cells). You can also use code as part of your answers (like plotting and printing, etc). Blue text indicates questions or things that you should discuss/comment, and there will red \"ANSWER (BEGIN)\" and \"ANSWER (END)\" markdown cells to indicate that you should add cells with your writeup between these two. **Make sure not to redefine variables or functions in your writeup, which can change the behavior of the next cells.**\n",

Better initialization probably helps to reduce the risk of disappearing/exploding gradients and to prevent the CNN from getting stuck in a local minimum. Batch normalization also prevents disappearing and exploding gradients. Adding residuals helps to reduce separation between earlier and later layers, which also helps to solve the vanishing gradient problem."
